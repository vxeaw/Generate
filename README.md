# generate

generate is a .NET 6 core sample ASP.Net application, with a single endpoint (/API/generate) that returns a single JSON object containing an autogenerated review, and a randomized star rating between 1 and 5. It ingests and trains data in program startup.


## Release Notes

generate has a single REST api (/API/generate) that returns JSON with an autogenerated review, a randomized star rating between 1 and 5 and other attributes of the review schema used by the training data file with test values.

**reviewText** contains the review

**overall** contains the rating

#### Example JSON result

> {
    "reviewerID": "337737",
    "asin": "",
    "reviewerName": "Markov",
    "reviewText": "Is an all natural with no additional sweetener (with all the canned condensed kind and is a real good apple flavor and not too soft, not too runny, too thick.",
    "overall": 5,
    "summary": "",
    "unixReviewTime": 0,
    "reviewTime": "11/3/2022 3:15:26 PM"
}

The training data zip file is included in the ./data folder and must be unzipped to .json (same name and location) before running generate. The file is loaded and processed when generate is first run (it does not wait for a request), so startup has a ~20 second delay.


generate uses
● Markov order 2 by default. Configurable via markovOrder setting.

● random configurable review length (wordCountMin, wordCountMax in settings).  The review length will exceed wordCountMax in order to finish the sentence in progress.

● random 1-5 for "overall" rating

Please see Settings section below

## Getting Started

● download the code

● build with .NET 6 core compatible tools of your choice

● unzip (in the same location)
    
    ./data/Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5.zip 

    to 
    
    ./data/Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5.json

● run the application (wait for startup to complete maybe 20 seconds)

● access (hit) the URL ./API/generate 

## Settings
Note: Changed settings take effect after restarting the application

**MarkovOrder** is the Markov algorithm size of word groups used generate the reviewText. Can be set 1-5.

**WordCountMin**, **WordCountMax** are lower and upper bound for the review word length, which is randomly generated in that range. The review will exceed wordCountMax in order to finish the sentence in progress. 

**TrainingDateFile** is the full path and file name to the JSON data for training

#### Example Settings from appsettings.json
 > "AppSettings": {
        "TrainingDataFile": ".\\data\\Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food_5.json",
        "MarkovOrder": 2,
        "WordCountMin": 15,
        "WordCountMax": 36
